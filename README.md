This engine can be used by anyone for free to make their own games. You can modify it however you like, or use it as a way to learn how RPGs work (kinda). I do request, however, that you credit me and include a link to [LegitVidya.com](http://www.legitvidya.com) in your game's documentation should you use it. You may distribute games made with this engine for free - NOT for profit. Also, remember to use your own graphics because these are borrowed assets as stated above.
